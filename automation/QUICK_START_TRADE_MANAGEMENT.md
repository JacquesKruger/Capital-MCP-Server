In n8n, delete and re-import these 3 workflows (they have new nodes):

1. `automation/n8n/workflows/risk_order_routing.json`
2. `automation/n8n/workflows/telegram_notifications.json`
3. `automation/n8n/workflows/telegram_approval_handler.json`

### Step 2: Import New Workflow

Import the new trade management workflow:

4. `automation/n8n/workflows/trade_management.json`

### Step 3: Activate All Workflows

Ensure these 7 workflows are ACTIVE in n8n:
- ‚úÖ Data & Signals
- ‚úÖ Risk & Order Routing

## üìä Example: Your First Trade

### With $1,000 Account Balance

**Signal**: BUY EURUSD @ 1.0850

**System Calculates**:
```
Entry Price:    1.0850
Position Size:  $400 USD (368.66 units)
Stop Loss:      1.0633 (-2%)
Take Profit:    1.1067 (+4%)
Risk Amount:    $8.00
Reserve Left:   $600 (60%)
```

**Telegram Notification**:
```
üö® TRADING INTENT PENDING

üìä SIGNAL
Symbol: EURUSD
Side: BUY
Strategy: ORB_VWAP

üí∞ POSITION SIZING
Entry: 1.0850
Position Size: $400.00 (368.66 units)
Risk Amount: $8.00
Stop Loss: 1.0633
Take Profit: 1.1067

üìù Rationale: ORB_VWAP - Risk: $8.00 (0.8%), Position: $400.00, Reserve: 60.0%

[‚úÖ Approve] [‚ùå Reject]
```

**After Approval**:
- Order placed with 368.66 units
- Stop-loss set at 1.0633
- Take-profit set at 1.1067
- Trade management monitors every 5 min

**If Stop Hit**: Position closed automatically, you lose $8 (0.8%)  
**If Target Hit**: Position closed automatically, you make $16 (1.6%)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Change Risk Per Trade

Edit `automation/scripts/position_sizer.py` line 28:
```python
max_risk_pct: float = 0.02,  # Change to 0.01 for 1% risk
```

Then restart:
```bash
docker restart trading-mcp-caller
```

### Change Reserve Requirement

Edit `automation/scripts/position_sizer.py` line 29:
```python
min_reserve_pct: float = 0.60,  # Change to 0.70 for 70% reserve
```

### Change Stop-Loss Distance

Edit `risk_order_routing.json`, "Calculate Position Size" node, line 172:
```json
"stop_loss_pct": 0.02  // Change to 0.015 for 1.5% stops
```

### Change Max Hold Time

Edit `trade_management.json`, "Evaluate Positions" node, line ~50:
```javascript
if (age_hours > 24) {  // Change 24 to desired hours
```

---

## üß™ Testing

### 1. Test Position Sizer
```bash
echo '{
  "available_capital": 1000,
  "current_price": 1.0850,
  "stop_loss_pct": 0.02,
  "instrument_type": "forex"
}' | curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/position_sizer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @-
```

**Expected**: Returns `position_size_usd: 400.0` and `reserve_after_entry: 600.0`

### 2. Check Database Schema
```bash
docker exec -i trading-db psql -U trader -d trading -c "\d intents"
```

**Expected**: Shows 7 new columns (position_size_usd, stop_loss_price, etc.)

### 3. Trigger a Signal
```bash
# Wait for data_signals workflow to run (every 5 min)
# Or manually trigger it in n8n
```

### 4. Check Risk Workflow Output
In n8n:
1. Open "Risk & Order Routing" workflow
2. Click "Execute Workflow"
3. Check "Create Intent" node output
4. Verify all new fields are populated

### 5. Check Telegram Message
Wait for notification and verify it includes:
- Position size in USD
- Risk amount
- Stop-loss price
- Take-profit price

### 6. Place a Test Order
1. Approve the trade
2. Check Capital.com account
3. Verify order has stop and target set

### 7. Test Trade Management
1. Wait 5 minutes
2. Check "Trade Management" workflow execution
3. Verify it found your open position
4. If target/stop hit, verify it closed automatically

## üì± What You'll See

### Telegram Notifications

**1. New Intent**:
```
üö® TRADING INTENT PENDING
Symbol: EURUSD
Side: BUY
Position Size: $400.00 (368.66 units)
Risk Amount: $8.00
Stop Loss: 1.0633
[‚úÖ Approve] [‚ùå Reject]
```

**2. Order Placed**:
```
‚úÖ Trade approved and order placed
Intent: intent_xyz
Size: 368.66 units
```

**3. Position Closed**:
```
üî¥ POSITION CLOSED
Symbol: EURUSD
Reason: TAKE_PROFIT_HIT
P&L: $16.00
take-profit reached
```

---

## üéØ System Behavior

### Position Sizing Logic
```
Max Deployable = Available Capital √ó 40%
Risk Amount = Available Capital √ó 2%
Position Size = Risk Amount √∑ Stop Distance %
```

**Example**:
- Capital: $1,000
- Max Deploy: $400 (40%)
- Risk: $20 (2%)
- Stop: 2%
- **Position**: $20 √∑ 0.02 = $1,000 ‚Üí **Capped at $400** (respects reserve)

### Trade Management Exit Rules

Position closes if **any** of these trigger:
1. **Stop-Loss Hit** - Price hits stop level
2. **Take-Profit Hit** - Price hits target level
3. **Max Hold Time** - Position held > 24 hours
4. **Loss Limit** - Loss exceeds 3% (emergency backup)

Checked **every 5 minutes** automatically.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Reserve Rule
- System **always** keeps 60% in reserve
- Max 40% can be deployed at once
- With $1,000 capital:
  - Max deployed: $400
  - Reserved: $600
  - Can't open position if reserve would drop below 60%

### Stop-Loss Protection
- Stop-loss is **critical** for position sizing to work
- Position size assumes stop will be hit if price moves against you
- Without stops, you risk more than calculated
- Always verify stop is set on broker after order

### Multiple Positions
- With $10,000 capital and 3 open positions:
  - Each position: Max $1,333
  - Total deployed: $4,000 (40%)
  - Reserved: $6,000 (60%)
- System prevents opening 4th position that would violate reserve

### Instrument Types
Position sizer supports:
- `forex` - Min 0.01 lots
- `crypto` - Min 0.001 BTC
- `stocks` - Min 1 share
- `indices` - Min 0.1 contracts
- `metals` - Min 0.01 oz

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Position size is 0
**Issue**: Position sizer not responding  
**Fix**: Check mcp-caller container:
```bash
docker logs trading-mcp-caller -f
docker restart trading-mcp-caller
```

### Stop not set on broker
**Issue**: Instrument doesn't support guaranteed stops  
**Fix**: Check Capital.com API docs for instrument requirements

### Reserve warning in notification
**Issue**: Position size exactly at 60% boundary  
**Fix**: This is OK! System prevents positions that would violate reserve

### Trade management not closing
**Issue**: Workflow not finding positions  
**Fix**:
1. Check workflow is active
2. Verify "Get Open Positions" returns data
3. Check position_id format

### No signals generated
**Issue**: Not enough candle data  
**Fix**: Wait for 50+ daily candles to accumulate (run data_signals multiple times)

## üìà Performance Monitoring

### Check Recent Intents
```bash
docker exec -i trading-db psql -U trader -d trading -c \
  "SELECT symbol, side, position_size_usd, risk_amount_usd, 
   stop_loss_price, take_profit_price, status 
   FROM intents 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

### Check System Events
```bash
docker exec -i trading-db psql -U trader -d trading -c \
  "SELECT event_type, severity, message, created_at 
   FROM system_events 
   WHERE source LIKE '%trade_management%' 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;"
```

### Check Current Exposure
```bash
# Via API
curl -s http://localhost:8000/mcp/get_positions | jq
```

## üéì Best Practices

1. **Start Small**
   - Test with minimum position sizes first
   - Verify entire flow works
   - Gradually increase as confident

2. **Monitor Initially**
   - Watch first 5-10 trades closely
   - Check Telegram notifications
   - Verify stops are set correctly

3. **Review Weekly**
   - Analyze which exit rules triggered
   - Check win rate and average P&L
   - Adjust parameters if needed

4. **Emergency Procedures**
   - Know how to deactivate workflows
   - Have Capital.com app ready
   - Can manually close positions anytime
